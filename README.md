# 黑客馅饼

This is my attemp to build a static site generator from scratch using *Rust*. It will be used to convert my thoughts on some articles I liked, written in Markdown, to HTML. Many static site generator requires [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to be present in the markdown file, which I don't really bother to do because I'm lazy. Simplicity is the goal.
